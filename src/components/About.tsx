          When I&apos;m not architecting AI systems or mentoring engineering teams, you&apos;ll find me exploring 
          cutting-edge cloud technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or earning new certifications 
          (AWS, GCP, Azure). With multiple professional certifications and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from George Mason University, 
          I&apos;m always ready to take on new challenges that require the calm determination of a Water Hashira.
